# Prefix Free Pipes

A "game" to help you learn about Hoffman encodings.

Make a message, and the letters will appear in the tree.

You can send a link to your friends, who will have to decode the message themselves.

Hint: You can change the total length of your encoded message by dragging the letters from one node to another. Try to make your encoded message as short as possible given the letters you used. Or, you can make it as long as you want!
